              Hello! I am a sophomore at Stony Brook University double majoring in Biomedical Engineering and Applied Mathematics & Statistics. I'm interested in biotechnology, data-driven research, and solving complex problems. I enjoy learning new skills across disciplines, and I'm always open to opportunities that help me grow technically and professionally.
              Feel free to connect with me and contact me at matthew.kuan@stonybrook.edu.
              I studied abroad at Yonsei University in Seoul, which
              sharpened how I adapt and communicate across very different environments.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 dark:text-neutral-300 text-base leading-relaxed">
              Outside of work, I&apos;m usually moving. I picked up bouldering and
              love heading out for outdoor climbs around the city — the climbing community is easily one of
              the most welcoming I&apos;ve found. I skateboard at
              the local skate park through the summer, and I spent high school managing a
              PSAL varsity fencing team, which taught me
              a lot about logistics, showing up for people, and keeping a group organized under pressure.
              Curiosity is the common thread through all of it — I&apos;m happiest when I&apos;m learning
              something new and figuring out how it fits together.
